# Anniversarry-Website

This project was created to celbrate my one year aniversary with Beta. 
I hate programming website but thought it would be the best way to create something that she can access at alll times. 
The website is mostly HTML and CSS as I wanted something more decorative. 
The Idea of this website is to have an art gallery to look back at some of the great and key memories I have with her
Please do not ask about the class names of the images. I too am confused
